🐠 Fish Swarm Optimisation (FSO) Modelling for Guppy Shoaling
🎯 A MERN-Based Predictive Simulator for Collective Behaviour Under Environmental Stress
🌍 1. Problem Description

The fundamental challenge this project addresses is the difficulty in systematically observing and quantifying the breakdown of complex collective behaviors in aquatic species—specifically the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)—under controlled, quantifiable stress.

Traditional observation-based methods fail to isolate how environmental parameters such as Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Feed Quality, Impurity Levels, and Light Intensity individually affect collective intelligence and shoaling cohesion.

This project introduces a computational simulation based on the Fish Swarm Optimization (FSO) algorithm to visualize, analyze, and quantify guppy swarm behavior in two conditions:

🟢 Normal (Optimal Shoaling)

🔴 Stressed (Degraded Shoaling)


 Solution: The FSO Predictive Simulator (MERN Stack)

This project delivers a Full-Stack MERN Application transforming FSO into a Predictive Resilience Simulator and Data Logger.

🖥️ Core Features

Interactive Stress Translation (Frontend)

Built with React.

Sliders let users manipulate DO, feed, impurity, and light intensity.

These inputs generate an Effective Stress Factor that dynamically alters fish behavior.

Quantifiable Output (Backend Simulation)

Metrics calculated:

Cohesion: Stability and tightness of shoal.

Convergence Efficiency: Effectiveness of resource search.

Real-time graphical display with persistent logging.

Data Persistence & Monetization (Database Layer)

MongoDB + Express backend for secure authentication and session storage.

Enables report generation and ML dataset creation for predictive modeling.
